# H1 Liri-Node-App
What the project does

LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line Node JS app that takes in parameters and gives you back data from web APIs about:
Songs and artists from spotify,
Bands and the venues they are performing at.
Movies and the generic information about its plot, actors, etc. 

LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.
